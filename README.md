# GamerCore

> [!NOTE]
> This project is no longer being worked on. I'm building another simulated e-commerce system from scratch based on the requirements from this project, observations from real e-commerce sites, and personal preferences: [DepresStore](https://github.com/maqnitude/DepresStore) (currently private).

## Project Organization

- Clients:
  - `GamerCore.AdminSite` (React + Vite + TypeScript)
  - `GamerCore.CustomerSite` (ASP.NET Core MVC)
- Server:
  - `GamerCore.Api` (ASP.NET Core controller-based API)
  - `GamerCore.Infrastructure` (Class library, manages EF Core stuff)
  - `GamerCore.Core` (Class library, contains entities and other common utilities)
